# Midterm 
# Memory game

I wanted to try and make a game of some kind with the Arduino system and a meory game is what came to mind at the time.
The game works useing code to pic a random led light and pressing the button that responds to it.
The game uses buttons as input and led's as output. I wanted the device to be small and easy to transport.

this is the finshed product, I cut some of the resistors and led's down to make it easier to move and less likly to fall apart.

# Parts: 
4 leds, resistors, wires, 4 buttons

# How the code Works

The game starts after about 3 seconds with 5 slow flashes of all the LEDs. After the 5 flashes complete, One LED will light up and the game begins.
Press the button for that LED. This LED will light up again followed by a new one. Press the correct buttons in sequence... etc.
When they flash rapidly that means you lost.

# what worked and what didn't work

Every thing worked as excpeted. The only issue I really had was I accidently placed one of the wire's in the wrong place during testing.

this is what the game looked like without me cutting down the resistors and leds.

# If i had more time

If i had more time i wouldn't change a thing it's fine as is.
