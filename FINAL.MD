I wanted to create something interesting and creating a computer mouse with the arduino system is what came to mind. 
The size of the project is the same size as a tv remote. The Joystick and buttons are the input and what happens on screen is the output.
I chose decided to use these components because they made the most sense to use.

 # Parts: Joystick, 2 resistors, wires, arduino micro, 2 buttons.
 
 # how the code works
Controls a PC mouse from a joystick on an Arduino Micro. The mouse movement is always relative.
The sketch assumes that the joystick resting values are around the 
middle of the range, but that they vary within a threshold.
WARNING:  When you use the new mouse, the Arduino takes
  over your mouse!  Make sure you have control before you use the project.
  This sketch includes a pushbutton to toggle the mouse on and off.
  also uses a separate button to act as mouse click instead of joystick button.

  # What worked and what didn't work.
  the code and design didn't work at first but with some help it finally started working as intended.

  # If I had more time
  If I had more time I wouldn't change a thing. I am glad to be done with this.
